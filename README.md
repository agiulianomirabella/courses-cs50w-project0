# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

 My project0 is about rock band Queen. It consists of five html pages, and in order to ease the correction, some information will be given to better identify where exactly every requirement of the project is fullfilled.
 
 Firstly, all files will be listed, pointing main requirements achievement and it specific loaction in [brackets], then, viceversa, for each requirement a specific location will be given.
 

Files list:
	- index.html: image [Queen logo section], list [Members], media query print (change "click here" to "visit ..." when printed)[Introduction].
	- discography.html: table [Studio Albums], flexbox [Studio Albums icons], media query (change margins, padding, and icon width) [Studio Albums icons].
	- freddie.html: image [About Freddie's Talent].
	- br.html: bootstrap, bootstrap card component [A Night at the Opera] with a bootstrap button, bootstrap grid structure usage.
	- members.html: bootstrap, better bootstrap grid structure usage.


Requirements list:
	- hyperlinks: in every html file, to every other one.
	- list: index.html

	- CSS @media query: two examples: for substitution of "click here" with "visit ..." when printing (in index.html, discography.html) and for reduction of margins, padding, and images width (in discography.html).
