    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="introParagraph">
        <p>
            Queen is a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was
            Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals),
            Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass).
            Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal,
            but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly
            works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.
